## Election-Audit Summary

This script can be useful in many other ways for this election or future elections with some modifications.

For this election with the given data set, we can modify this script to get the percentage of votes for each candidate per district, this would allow us to see where each candidate was more popular. We could also check the ballot's id to see if there are any missing ballots.

For future elections, we can use this script to get the same information that we got on this election, but depending on the given data set we could expand further. For example, if we had gender or age information of the voters, we could search if there is a tendency to vote for a specific candidate depending on that.

These are only a few examples of everything that can be done with this script.
